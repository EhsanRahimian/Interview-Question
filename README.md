# Interview-Question


Suppose you want to bring the whole company together for 
a gigantic meeting of the minds.

Your company has N employees, and you have their schedules available 
as N lists of <begin, end> timestamp pairs, which indicate times that 
each individual person is busy.

Each list is sorted and there are no overlaps within a single list.

Find a list of times (<begin, end> timestamp pairs) during which 
all N people are free.

You should specify a beginHour and endHour time. 
We don't care about times before or after that time
